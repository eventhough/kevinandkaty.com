# About Us

We first met at Kevin's 29th birthday party in San Francisco. Kevin was hosting an event called The Wu Party with his friend Jamie Wu.

Here's the event image from the original Facebook invite:

</a>

When we first met, Katy wasn't able to see Kevin's face clearly because he was wearing a pair of light up sunglasses. As the night progressed Kevin knew he had to dance with the "Tall Asian Girl" and they seemed to hit it off.

This is probably what Kevin looked like when Katy first saw him:

</a>

We've spent the last two years exploring San Francisco together and are proud to call the Bay Area home. We implore all of our guests to reach out to us for recommendations on what to see and do in the place we call home.
