# About Us

Kevin and Katy first met at Kevin's 29th birthday party in San Francisco. Kevin was hosting an event called The Wu Party with his friend Jamie Wu.

Here's the event image from the original Facebook invite:

When they first met, Katy wasn't able to see Kevin's face clearly because he was wearing a pair of light up sunglasses. As the night progressed Kevin knew he had to dance with the "Tall Asian Girl" and they seemed to hit it off.

Over the last two years Katy and Kevin have explored the city together and are proud to call the Bay Area home.
