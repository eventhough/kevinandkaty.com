### Welcome!

We are so excited for you to share in our wedding day! Sonoma is a beautiful historic city in Northern California that is renowned for its wine and food experiences. Even though we met in San Francisco, we have a soft spot for wine country, and hope that you will join us in eating, drinking and being merry!

Please note that Sonoma is a 45-60 minute drive north of San Francisco. If your travel plans will involve an airplane, we recommend that you fly into San Francisco International Airport (SFO) or Oakland International Airport (OAK), and rent a car. Wine country is most conveniently explored by car.

The Barn is located at 150 Wagner Road, Sonoma, CA 95476 ([Google Map](https://www.google.com/maps/place/150+Wagner+Rd,+Sonoma,+CA+95476/@38.228457,-122.4563757,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x8085af4e44845591:0xd6177cad4bf2207c)).
It is just past a large property called Cornerstone Sonoma and across the road from Gloria Ferrer Caves & Vineyards. If you see those signs, you are in the right place - just keep going down Wagner Road!

Hope to see you soon! Until then, please browse this site for more information regarding accommodations and things to do.
