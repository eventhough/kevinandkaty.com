# The Proposal

## Plan A - Point Reyes

Kevin's original plan was to propose to Katy in [Point Reyes National Seashore](http://www.nps.gov/pore/index.htm) which is an amazing national park just one hour north of San Francisco. He enlisted his good friend Alan Hwang to help him write "Katy will you marry me?" on the beach below a cliff.

Unfortunately after scouting out the area, Kevin and Alan decided it was not going to work out since Alan would likely die trying to get around a treacherous ocean cliff.

## Plan B - Carmel

Not wanting to risk Alan's delicate life, Kevin decided Carmel would be a great second choice since it met all the requirements of a Katy-approved vacation:

1. Ocean
2. Seafood
3. Massage

Before dinner on the first night Kevin told Katy he wanted to "go looking for sea otters". He took Katy to [Carmel River State Beach](http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=567) and waited patiently for everyone to leave so he could pop the question.

Next time you are in Carmel, consider staying at the [Tickle Pink Inn](http://www.ticklepinkinn.com/).
